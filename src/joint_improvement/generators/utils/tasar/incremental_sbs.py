"""
(Improving) Incremental Stochastic Beam Search (SBS) implementation for NumPy, mainly based on the implementation in UniqueRandomizer
https://github.com/google-research/unique-randomizer/blob/master/unique_randomizer/unique_randomizer.py
with alterations, such as:
    - Our log prob modification, see below.
    - batching SBS to allow higher batch sizes in the policy network
    - flag for keeping memory low (i.e., deleting client states after they have been visited but keeping the logits)

The key idea is to modify the log-probabilities of nodes in sampled trajectories. We do this in two ways:
1.) Subtract the log-prob of a sampled sequence from all intermediate nodes in the sequence. This is incremental
    SBS, where we perform sampling without replacement over many batches.
2.) Use the sampled trajectories to compute the expected objective over the policy (derived from priority sampling),
    then update the log-probs of all intermediate nodes with the advantage of the trajectory over the expectation.
    Note: we need to be careful about proper normalization.
